# Project Planner

A sprint-based project planning tool built in React. Designed for consulting engagements where you need to quickly model team allocations, timelines, and costs across multiple workstreams — without standing up a database or a heavyweight PM tool.

No backend. No database. Saves automatically to browser localStorage, with JSON export/import for sharing.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`. Requires Node.js 16+. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it.

## Features

### Resources
- Add team members with name, role/title, and location (US/India dropdown)
- Set bill rate and cost rate per person
- Margin % auto-computed and color-coded (green = positive, red = inverted)

### Workstreams
- Group related tasks into workstreams (e.g. Data Platform, API Layer, UI)
- Default tasks per workstream: Design, LLD, Dev, Test, Prod — fully customizable
- Collapse/expand individual workstreams
- Move tasks up/down within a workstream
- Add dependencies as comma-separated pills (type and press Enter)

### Sprint planning
- Each sprint = 2 weeks; calendar dates auto-computed from project start date
- Set start sprint and duration independently per task — tasks don't have to be sequential
- Over-budget warning when a task runs past the project end sprint

### Resource allocation
- Assign multiple resources to any task with % allocation
- Senior resources can be split across workstreams (e.g. 50% on two tasks simultaneously)
- Live over-allocation detection — warns by resource and sprint when total exceeds 100%

### Timeline (Gantt)
- Color-coded sprint grid across all workstreams
- Updates live as you change sprint assignments
- Printable

### Cost summary
- Cost by resource: weighted sprints × 10 days × 8 hours × bill rate
- Cost by workstream and task
- Grand total across the project

### Persistence
- Auto-saves to browser localStorage on every change
- Export to JSON (Save JSON button) for sharing or backup
- Import JSON to restore any saved plan
- Print view for workstreams and timeline

## Cost formula

```
Cost = sprints × (allocation% / 100) × 10 work days × 8 hours × bill rate ($/hr)
```

Margin is computed as:
```
Margin % = (bill rate - cost rate) / bill rate × 100
```

## Roadmap ideas

- [ ] Parallel task tracks within a workstream
- [ ] Capacity heatmap view per resource
- [ ] Export to Excel / CSV
- [ ] Multi-project comparison
- [ ] Role-based resource templates
